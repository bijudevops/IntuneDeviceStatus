# Intune Management Status Checker

A PowerShell script to determine if a Windows device is **managed by Microsoft Intune**.  
It gathers signals from Azure AD join status, MDM enrollment keys, and the Intune Management Extension service, then produces a clear verdict.

---

## üîç Features
- Runs `dsregcmd /status` to check **Azure AD Join** and **MDM enrollment URL**.
- Reads registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments` for **MS DM Server** enrollment.
- Detects the **Intune Management Extension** service (Win32 app management).
- Outputs a structured summary and a human-readable **Conclusion**.
- Returns an **exit code** for scripting/automation:
  - `0` = Intune-managed / likely managed
  - `1` = Not Intune-managed
